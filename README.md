The DA16200MOD is an ultra low power WiFi module manufactured by [Dialog (a subsidiary of Renesas)](https://www.renesas.com/us/en). It contains a 802.11b/g/n radio (PHY), a baseband processor, a media access controller (MAC), on-chip memory, and a host networking application processor, all on a single silicon die. The system on a chip (SoC) has full offload capabilities to run the entire networking OS and TCP/IP stack on chip; therefore, an external network processor, CPU, or microcontroller are not required.

The module is Wi-Fi Alliance certified for IEEE802.11b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct, WPS functionalities and it has been approved by many countries including the United States (FCC), Canada (IC) and China (SRRC). Using the Wi-Fi Alliance transfer policy, the Wi-Fi Certifications can be transferred without being tested again. 

This module is now available in a [Thing Plus form factor](https://www.sparkfun.com/thing_plus), which includes a Qwiic and LiPo battery connectors, multiple GPIO pins, and JTAG PTH pins for debugging. The SparkFun Thing Plus - DA16200 is ideal for your next IoT project, thanks in part to the multiple sleep modes that allow you to take advantage of current draws as low as 0.2 - 3.5 &micro;A on the WiFi module.

***Note:** Please be aware that the Thing Plus - DA16200 has a **3.3V** logic level voltage.*

_The SparkFun [Qwiic connect system](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) is an ecosystem of I2C sensors, actuators, shields and cables that make prototyping faster and less prone to error. All Qwiic-enabled boards use a common 1mm pitch, 4-pin JST connector. This reduces the amount of required PCB space, and polarized connections mean you can't hook it up wrong._
